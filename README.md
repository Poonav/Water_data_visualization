Water quality is a crucial aspect of environmental management, and it is essential to measure various physical, chemical, and biological parameters to monitor it effectively. This dataset of 200 rows contains measurements of six critical water quality parameters widely used in water quality monitoring and analysis. The dataset provides a representative snapshot of water quality and can be used for various research, education, and decision-making purposes.

The six parameters measured in this dataset are:

pH: pH measures the acidity or basicity of a liquid on a scale from 0 to 14. Values less than 7 indicate acidic conditions, values greater than 7 suggest primary needs and a value of 7 indicates a neutral state.

Dissolved Oxygen (DO): DO measures the amount of oxygen dissolved in water and is essential for aquatic life. High DO levels are crucial for the survival of fish and other marine organisms.

Temperature: Temperature affects various physical, chemical, and biological processes in water bodies. It is an essential factor that influences the rate of many aquatic processes.
